Thank you for installing CSV. All commands are available through keyboard shortcuts, menus, context menus and the command palette.

To enable cell evaluation, download NumPy from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy, and install it into your Sublime Text Packages directory.

Please direct any feedback to wadetb@gmail.com or through github at https://github.com/wadetb/Sublime-Text-3-CSV-Plugin.
